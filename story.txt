Once upon a time, there was a frog that lived in a pretty castle up on the tallest hill in the world. The frog was unnoticed.. wandering the castle's underboroughs whilst
no one knew of it's existence. This frog had a prophecy.. to become the next king to rule the world yet the frog did not know of it's destiny. The current King and his 
knights searched far and wide for this frog, trying to fufill the fabled prophecy yet after 20 years of searching far and wide, they came up empty handed. The final words of the prophecy was 
hidden from the original writing. The final words stated, "after 21 years of the frogs life, it shall appear as if it was there all along."
