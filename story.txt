Once upon a time, there was a frog that lived in a pretty castle up on the tallest hill in the world. The frog was unnoticed.. wandering the castle's underboroughs whilst
no one knew of it's existence. This frog had a prophecy.. to become the next king to rule the world yet the frog did not know of it's destiny. The current King and his 
knights searched far and wide for this frog, trying to fufill the fabled prophecy yet after 20 years of searching far and wide, they came up empty handed. The final words of the prophecy was hidden from the original writing. The final words stated, "after 21 years of the frogs life, it shall appear as if it was there all along." 

However, there is a twist in this story. Apparently, the frog fell of the top of the castle, and turned into a dog! He started barking all night because the prophecy clearly stated that to be the king he had to be a frog. Now, he will never make love with the queen- the only reason he wanted to become a king.
